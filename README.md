Data Structure And algorithm

I am simply trying to learn the Data Structure and algorithm using Javascript.

Target: to add all the required algorithms as I learn and also to add some problems as I learn. 

I have added HTML file incase if you prefer browser's developer tool's console. If not, node.js users know what to do.

I am still at the learning phase, so incase if you find any better way to do/solve the problems and data algorithm, please comment or do a PR.


Lets Code!
